# ttmfe-component-lib

Welcome to the demo from my Tech Talk about Micro Frontends.
This code is used in conjunction with several other small repos. The inability of GitHub to provide a grouping function makes this a little impractical.
For the full story and all necessary repos, checkout the Host application at https://github.com/cabalse/ttmfe-host

This is a React Component Library that I used to show and test the build-time inclusion of code as part of a Component-based Monolith solution and a way to address problems in Micro Frontends of building coherent applications (nothing new under the sun).

# Example

This Component Library follows the YouTube tutorial found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OHZmM0ihIQ
